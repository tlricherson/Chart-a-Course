How does a student's path through our system connect with their performance in math?

## Overview ##
Every student has personal attributes that they bring to school. Student learning is affected also by other factors, such as curriculum and instruction. In this story, we look at how the external sequence of teachers and courses connects with the internal factors of students to impact longitudinal performance in math.



## How to read the display ##




## Construction ##
The display represents 452 students and is made of more than 3200 pieces of quilled paper held together by glue. Each student representation is attached to a fabric-covered cork board by at least one map pin.

Each board is 2' x 3' (.6m x .9m) for a total size of 12' x 3' (3.65m x .9m). It is currently displayed by using picture hangers to attach it to two large bulletin boards in a hallway of our school district office.

## Learn more ##
We have been building large-scale, physical data displays for more than two years. After they have spent time in our school district office, we move them into other areas of the community, including our regional educational service district, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and (soon!) Evergreen State College and Timberland Regional Libraries.

Additional details about all of the displays are available on our district [Data Stories](https://www.tumwater.k12.wa.us/Page/7852) web site, or on my personal blog under the [stories](http://excelforeducators.blogspot.com/search/label/stories) label.
